# Picker Widget
## Overview
This is a widget for the [Alloy](http://projects.appcelerator.com/alloy/docs/Alloy-bootstrap/index.html) MVC framework of [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com)'s [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform) platform.

This widget is a modification of the https://github.com/danielhanold/danielhanold.pickerwidget shaped and adjusted to work on Backbase SDK.

This widget attempts to normalize cross-platform differences and general idiosyncrasies with the Titanium SDK. Currently, the widget needs to be initiated in the controller. The widget provides iOS and Android support for the date picker.
